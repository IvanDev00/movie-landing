                     In Muromachi Japan, an Emishi village is attacked by a
                     hideous demon. The last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills it
                     before it reaches the village, but it manages to grasp his
                     arm and curse him before its death. The curse grants him
                     some superhuman strength, but it also causes him pain and
                     will eventually kill him. The villagers discover that the
                     demon was a boar god, corrupted by an iron ball lodged in
                     his body. The village's wise woman tells Ashitaka that he
                     may find a cure in the western lands that the demon came
                     from, and that he cannot return to his homeland.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                     Heading west, Ashitaka meets Jigo, an opportunistic monk
                     who tells Ashitaka he may find help from the Great Forest
                     Spirit, a deer-like animal god by day and a giant Night
                     Walker by night. Nearby, men on a cliffside herd oxen to
                     their home of Iron Town, led by Lady Eboshi, and repel an
                     attack by a wolf pack led by the wolf goddess Moro, whom
                     Eboshi wounds with a gun shot. Riding one of the wolves is
                     San, a human girl. Down below, Ashitaka encounters San and
                     the wolves, who rebuff his greeting. He then manages to
                     rescue two of the men fallen from the cliff and transports
                     them back through the forest, where he briefly glimpses the
                     Great Forest Spirit.

                     Ashitaka and the survivors arrive at Iron Town, where he is
                     greeted with fascination. Iron Town is a refuge for
                     outcasts and lepers employed to process iron and create
                     firearms, such as hand cannons and matchlock muskets.
                     Ashitaka learns that the town was built by clearcutting
                     forests to mine the iron, leading to conflicts with Asano,
                     a local daimyō, and a giant boar god named Nago. Eboshi
                     admits that she shot Nago, incidentally turning him into
                     the demon that attacked Ashitaka's village. She also
                     reveals that San, dubbed Princess Mononoke, was raised by
                     the wolves and resents humankind.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                     Suddenly, San infiltrates Iron Town to kill Eboshi.
                     Ashitaka intervenes and quickly subdues Eboshi and San
                     while they are locked in combat. Amidst the hysteria, he is
                     shot by a villager but the curse gives him strength to
                     carry San out of the village. San awakens and prepares to
                     kill the weakened Ashitaka, but hesitates when he tells her
                     that she is beautiful. She decides to trust him after the
                     Forest Spirit heals his bullet wound that night. The next
                     day, a boar clan led by the blind god Okkoto plans to
                     attack Iron Town to save the forest. Eboshi sets out to
                     kill the Forest Spirit with Jigo; Eboshi intends to give
                     the god's head to the Emperor (who believes it will grant
                     him immortality) in return for protection from Lord Asano,
                     while Jigo desires the large reward being offered.

                     Ashitaka recovers and finds Iron Town besieged by Asano's
                     samurai. The boar clan has also been annihilated in battle,
                     and Okkoto is badly wounded. Jigo's men then trick Okkoto
                     into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries to stop
                     Okkoto but is swept up as his pain corrupts him into a
                     demon. As everyone clashes at the pool of the Forest
                     Spirit, Ashitaka saves San while the Forest Spirit kills
                     Moro and Okkoto. As it begins to transform into the Night
                     Walker, Eboshi decapitates it. Jigo steals the head, while
                     the Forest Spirit's body bleeds ooze that spreads over the
                     land and kills anything it touches. The forest and kodama
                     begin to die; Moro's head comes alive and bites off
                     Eboshi's right arm, but she survives.

                  <br />
                  <p>
                     After Iron Town is evacuated, Ashitaka and San pursue Jigo
                     and retrieve the head, returning it to the Forest Spirit.
                     The Spirit dies but its form washes over the land, healing
                     it and lifting Ashitaka's curse. Ashitaka stays to help
                     rebuild Iron Town, but promises San he will visit her in
                     the forest. Eboshi vows to build a better town. The forest
                     begins to regrow as a single kodama emerges from the brush.
